# Rotor-A

Simple 3D shoot'em up game based on Godot Engine. Helicopter adventure.

This project will help you to learn [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org). Version 4.3 was used here.

**3** levels.  
**3** types of weapons.  
**3** types of power ups.  
**6** types of enemies.  

Maybe I'll add scoring, sounds, and music to the game.
